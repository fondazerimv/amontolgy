# AM00 Ontolgy

The following repository contains material concerning the AM00 - Zeri Art Market Ontology. This model analyzes transaction and relevant entities in the art market starting from the data available in the Fondazione Zeri Photo Archive. This project is carried out by Manuele Veggi both as internship activity (January - March 2023, tutor: Prof Mambelli) and as Collegio Superiore final thesis (tutor: Prof Iannucci, co-tutor: Prof Mambelli).
