# Zeri Art Market Ontology

The following repository contains material concerning the Zeri Art Market Ontology (ZAMO, link to documentation soon available), an OWL 2 DL ontology analyzing most relevant entities and properties in the art market starting from the data available in the Fondazione Zeri Photo Archive. This project is carried out by Manuele Veggi and was firstly conceived as internship activity (January - March 2023, tutor: Prof Mambelli) at the Fondazione Zeri - Bologna and later completed as Collegio Superiore final thesis (tutor: Prof Iannucci, co-tutor: Prof Peroni).

ZAMO has been developed following [SAMOD](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3189769), the Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development.

This repository contains the full documentation produced during the development of the ontology. In particular:
- the ```samod``` directory contains the material produced during SAMOD iterations, i.e. Motivating Scenario, a set of examples use case, a list of Informal Competency Questions (in English), their translation into SPARQL, a Graffoo diagram of the model in .png format (along with its .graphml file), a TBox and a ABox. For the organization of the material in the subfolder, please read the corresponding [note](samod/samod.md).
- the ```docs``` directory contains all the files related to the ontology and its versions in time;
