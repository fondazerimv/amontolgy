## Scenario

**General overview of the main agents in the art market**

An art dealer activity can be carried out by either a person, specialized in a particular discipline, or an organization, which can be of various types, including an auction house, and has a person in charge (managing director). There may be people and organizations that do not carry out an art dealer activity but are nevertheless involved in the cultural industry.

## Examples

1) SR, specialized in Mannerist painting, is in charge of the auction house <i>Antichit√†</i>.
2) MF, specialized in Baroque sculpture, oversees the art gallery <i>Beaux Arts</i>.
3) BV is the director of <i>Universo mostre</i>, an organization which cannot be considered properly as an art dealer, albeit it operates in the artistic sector.
