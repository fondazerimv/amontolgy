## Scenario

**Possible different organizations of an art-dealer company**

The company is defined by a foundation, which establishes the involved actors, the name, the location, the date, and the type of activity. Several companies may refer to the same family venture, which indicates all business activities owned by the members of the same family. The company may open new branches and laboratory.

## Examples

1) The art dealer ST, after opening the <i>Arti d'Urbe</i> gallery in Rome, Piazza delle Erbe, in 1949, opened a restoration laboratory in Rome, Piazza Navona, in 1956
2) The art dealer CP opened a second branch of the Galleria <i>Artimercato</i> in Florence in Via dei Fossi in 1977.
3) LZ and PS founded a gallery together in Rome in 1980 under the name “Arti libere”.
