## Scenario

**Professional roles and collaborations in the art market**

An art dealer organization society makes use of various professional figures provided by the individual or by another society, with whom it forms collaborative ties defined by a time interval and functional to an event or object.

In addition to the person in charge, the main figures (there may be more than one) are the reference scholar (who has a background on an art-historical domain; he intervenes for attributions and catalogs), the restorer, and the photographer.  

## Examples

1) The antiquarian GT has several artworks without attribution. He therefore asks AB (a leading expert in the history of the miniature) to collaborate and study these works. This collaboration is occasional and lasts from 1980 to 1982.
2) In order to study the works properly, collaborator AB asks for photographs. Therefore, GT asks photographer AA, with whom he collaborated from 1960 until 1985, to take the photos. 
3) FR calls three experts with different skills to draw up a catalogue: GO, a scholar of Baroque sculpture, LA, a scholar of Mannerist painting, AB, a scholar of the history of the miniature. The photographer DD also worked on the catalogue (permanent collaboration from 1950 till 1975).
4) FZ, who had owned the company <i>Antichità fiorentine” </i> since 1920, died in 1948. The business was continued by his son MZ until 1970. The company was founded by FZ's uncle AQ in 1910.
