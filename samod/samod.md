## Organization of the materials for SAMOD Methodology implementation

This subfolder contains the material produced during the iterations foreseen by [SAMOD Methodology](https://essepuntato.it/samod/), subdivided into the three different modules in which the ontology is articulated.

In each of the three folders you can find the single modelets, the corresponding scenario, examples and competency questions, and the following milestone. Following this methodology, the standalone modelets have been iteratively merged and lastly refactored. Please note that in this last step also the URI of the ontology has been changed, which shoudl be taken into account when trying to reproduce the SPARQL competency questions.

The different modules are specified as `zamo/agents#`, `zamo/events#`, and `zamo/sources#`.
