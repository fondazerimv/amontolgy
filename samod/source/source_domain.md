## Scenario

**Sources for the historical reconstruction of the art market**

Objects  may  mainly  (but  not  only)  be  bibliographic  (comprising various types, including catalogues) or archival item (such as, but not limited to, account ledgers, receipts, letters, photos) and works of art; they  may  be  contained  within  a  curated  holding  (library,  archive, including photo archive, or art collection; they may have extension indications)  which  is  identified  by  a  current  owner  (an  agent)  and which may in turn be contained by another holding.These elements can be used as sources for events or agents: some of them are precipitates of  the agent's activity (primary source), while others are the result of later studies (secondary source).

1) The archival collection of the antiquarian GT, comprising 600  photos  and  300  letters  from  1940  to  1990,  is  now owned by the SZ Foundation.
