# Scenario

The peculiarity of the art market is the fact that the value of an artwork cannot be deduced objectively but depends on multiple external factors. In fact, an agent can value the work independently or by relying on an expert. He reconstructs several characteristics of the work of art. Among these, some important ones are the artefact's authorship (attribution), state of preservation, collecting history (understood as a series of possessions), bibliography. Based on this analysis, an agent proposes a monetary value for the object. Both the attribution and the value proposition can be rediscussed over time by other attributive assignments: all these events influence (without necessarily coinciding) the real price of the transaction. The asset may be subject to notification (usually not withdrawn but may only be valid for a certain amount of time) by the State and this affects the value of the asset.

# Examples

1. In 2001, the antiquarian PT calls the reference scholar SB to have him study a 17th century painting (<i>San Rocco</i>). He attributes the artwork to Guido Reni.
2. In 2005 SB studies a <i>Deposition</i> attributed to Guido Reni: after some research he attributes it instead to Domenichino.
3. The antiquarian SZ owns a painting by Tintoretto, whose value in 1980 was €15,000 because a previous appraisal showed it to be in a good state of conservation and the work is mentioned in the catalogue <i>Le opere di Tintoretto</i>.
4. Based on the analysis of Tintoretto's canvas by the scholar ML, commissioned by SZ, it was discovered that the work was owned by Count F. SZ put it on sale in 1990 at the equivalent cost of 35,000€ and at 30,000€ in 1991
5. The work <i>San Rocco</i> by Guido Reni was notified in 2008 by the Italian State
