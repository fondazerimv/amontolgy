## Scenario

**Transaction typologies in the art market**

An agent may have ownership and custody (they do not mandatorily match) of an object or a set of artworks. An agent's main activity is the transaction, which include buying (an agent sells an asset in exchange for a sum of money; it changes possession, custody or both), lending (an agent lends an asset in exchange for a sum of money or free of charge, which changes only custody), and donating (an agent gives an asset away free of charge: in this case, both possession and custody change). The asset is defined as a lot and may be a single work or a group of works of art (sometimes even an entire collection). The transaction is identified by at least two parties: one who transfers possession and one who acquires it. A transaction may also have a facilitator
